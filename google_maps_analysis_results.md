- Add provider credential verification from external sources
- Implement ML-based recommendation algorithms

## Data Gaps and Mitigation Strategies

### Missing Data Elements
1. **Insurance Networks**: Not available in Google data
   - *Mitigation*: Integrate with insurance provider APIs
2. **Provider Credentials**: Licensing info not included
   - *Mitigation*: Cross-reference with medical board databases
3. **Real-time Availability**: Appointment slots not tracked
   - *Mitigation*: Integrate with practice management systems
4. **Detailed Services**: General categories only
   - *Mitigation*: Parse business descriptions and names for specialties

## Technical Implementation Notes

### SQL Access Pattern
```sql
-- Sample query for CareConnect healthcare provider search
SELECT 
    name,
    category,
    address,
    lat,
    lon,
    phone_number,
    open_website
FROM `dais-hackathon-2025`.bright_initiative.google_maps_businesses 
WHERE 
    LOWER(category) IN ('doctor', 'medical clinic', 'hospital', 'pharmacy')
    AND lat BETWEEN ? AND ?  -- Bounding box search
    AND lon BETWEEN ? AND ?
    AND name IS NOT NULL 
    AND address IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    -- Distance calculation would go here
    SQRT(POWER(lat - ?, 2) + POWER(lon - ?, 2))
LIMIT 50;
```

### Data Processing Requirements
- Coordinate validation and normalization
- Phone number standardization
- Category mapping to healthcare taxonomy
