-- Expected schema (to be confirmed)
CREATE TABLE google_maps_businesses (
    business_id STRING,
    name STRING,
    category STRING,
    address STRING,
    latitude DOUBLE,
    longitude DOUBLE,
    rating DOUBLE,

    phone STRING,
    website STRING,
    hours STRING,
    price_level INT,
    permanently_closed BOOLEAN,
    -- Additional fields may include:
    services ARRAY<STRING>,
    amenities ARRAY<STRING>,
    photos ARRAY<STRING>,
    place_id STRING
);
```

## Analysis Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Schema Discovery
1. Execute `DESCRIBE TABLE` to understand structure
2. Analyze column types and constraints
3. Identify primary keys and indexes

### Phase 2: Data Profiling
1. Run row count and basic statistics
2. Analyze null value percentages
3. Examine data distributions

### Phase 3: Healthcare Provider Identification
1. Search for healthcare-related categories
2. Analyze business names for healthcare keywords
3. Create healthcare provider subset

### Phase 4: Quality Assessment
1. Evaluate completeness of key fields
2. Validate geographic coordinates
3. Assess rating and review data quality

### Phase 5: Suitability Analysis
1. Map to CareConnect requirements
2. Identify data gaps
3. Assess integration complexity

## CareConnect Integration Considerations

### Required Data Elements for Provider Recommendations
1. **Provider Identity**: Name, type, specialties
2. **Location**: Address, coordinates for distance calculations
3. **Quality Metrics**: Ratings, review counts
4. **Contact**: Phone, website for appointment booking
5. **Availability**: Hours of operation
6. **Services**: Specific medical services offered

### Data Transformation Requirements
1. **Category Standardization**: Map Google categories to healthcare taxonomy
2. **Address Normalization**: Standardize address formats
3. **Coordinate Validation**: Verify lat/lng accuracy
4. **Quality Scoring**: Develop composite quality metrics

### Potential Data Gaps
1. **Insurance Acceptance**: Provider insurance networks
2. **Appointment Availability**: Real-time scheduling data
3. **Specialized Services**: Detailed service offerings
4. **Provider Credentials**: Licensing and certification info
5. **Patient Reviews**: Healthcare-specific review content

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Dataset
- At least 1,000 healthcare providers with complete core data
- Geographic coverage matching CareConnect's target areas
- 80%+ completeness for name, category, address, coordinates
- 60%+ completeness for rating and contact information

### Optimal Dataset
- 10,000+ healthcare providers across all major categories
- Comprehensive geographic coverage
- 95%+ completeness for core fields
- Rich metadata including services and amenities

## Next Steps

1. **Execute SQL Analysis**: Run the provided SQL queries against the table
2. **Data Quality Report**: Compile findings into comprehensive report
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing data elements needed for CareConnect
4. **Integration Planning**: Design data pipeline for ongoing updates
5. **Pilot Implementation**: Test with sample provider recommendations

## Risk Assessment

### Data Quality Risks
