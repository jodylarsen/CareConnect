   - Singleton pattern for optimal performance
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Multiple location acquisition methods
   - Geocoding utilities

2. **PlacesService** (`src/services/placesService.ts`)
   - Google Places API wrapper
   - Healthcare-specific search algorithms
   - Place details enhancement
   - Specialty search capabilities

### Enhanced Components
1. **HealthcareSearch** - Updated to use new services
2. **MapView** - Enhanced with better markers and interactions
3. **Dashboard** - Added Google services testing tab
4. **GoogleServicesTest** - Comprehensive testing interface

### Configuration
- Environment variables properly configured in `.env`
- Google Maps API key: `AIzaSyA6yxuctjCrlNsidvVpxy1jaFJc9Yp12pQ`
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Error boundaries and fallback mechanisms

## Key Features Implemented

### üåç Location Services
- **High-accuracy geolocation** with fallback options
- **Address resolution** with detailed location components
- **Permission management** with user-friendly error messages
- **Distance calculations** with mile/kilometer support

### üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Maps
- **Real-time location display** with custom user marker
- **Healthcare provider markers** with type-specific icons
- **Interactive InfoWindows** with provider selection
- **Map controls** for location acquisition
- **Responsive design** with legend and zoom controls

### üè• Healthcare Provider Search

- **Radius-based filtering** with customizable distance
- **Rating and review integration** from Google Places
- **Specialty searches** for specific medical needs (dialysis, STI testing, COVID testing)
- **Business status** and hours information

### üîç Advanced Search Capabilities
- **Symptom-based recommendations** (placeholder for Zach's LLM integration)
- **Text search** for specific facility names or services
- **Filter combinations** (type, rating, distance, open status)
- **Accessibility considerations** in search results

## Testing & Validation

### GoogleServicesTest Component
- **Comprehensive test suite** for all Google services
- **Real-time test results** with detailed logging
- **Interactive testing** of location and places services
- **Error handling validation** with fallback testing
- **Performance monitoring** for API response times

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Location permission checking
- ‚úÖ Current location acquisition
- ‚úÖ IP-based location fallback
- ‚úÖ Forward/reverse geocoding
- ‚úÖ Distance calculations
- ‚úÖ Healthcare provider search
- ‚úÖ Specialty finding
- ‚úÖ Place details retrieval
- ‚úÖ Photo URL generation

## Integration Points

### Ready for Databricks Integration
- **Modular architecture** allows easy swapping of Google Places with Databricks API
- **Standardized interfaces** for healthcare providers and locations
- **Error handling patterns** compatible with remote API calls
- **Loading states** and user feedback mechanisms

### API Compatibility
- Healthcare provider data structure compatible with Zach's expected format
- Location services provide exact coordinates needed for distance calculations
- Search filters align with expected Databricks API parameters

## Performance Optimizations

- **Service initialization** only when needed
- **API call caching** through Google's built-in mechanisms
- **Marker clustering** for large result sets
- **Lazy loading** of place details
- **Debounced search** to reduce API calls

## Security Considerations

- **API key restrictions** should be configured in Google Cloud Console
- **Client-side only** - no sensitive operations
- **Error message sanitization** to prevent information leakage
- **Rate limiting awareness** with graceful degradation

## Next Steps for Integration

1. **Update Google Cloud Console** with authorized origins:
   - Add `http://localhost:3001` for development
   - Add production domain when deployed

2. **Databricks API Integration**:
   - Replace PlacesService calls with Databricks endpoints
   - Maintain the same interface for seamless integration
   - Enhance with ML-powered provider recommendations

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Configure environment-specific API keys
   - Set up monitoring and error tracking
   - Implement caching strategies for performance
